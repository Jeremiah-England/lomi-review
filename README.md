## Questions

- What is the up-front cost?
  - What does main the system cost + shipping?
- What is the operational cost?
  - What is the cost of electricity?
    - 1kWh per cycle. Less than 3 cycles a week (I assume). $0.12/kWh in SC. So
      3 cycles/week * $0.12/kwh * 4 weeks/month = $1.44/month. Not a relevant
      cost.
  - What kind of pods and recurring materials cost does it have?
  - What kind of maintenance is there, if any?
- How convenient is it?
  - Do you have to clean it often?
  - Is it hard to clean?
- How long will it last?
